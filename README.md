The purpose of this repo is to create a python based framework for text-based adventure games.

At current there is plans for 2 main files, one for classes and another for input handling.  There will also be an example of the exe code.  

## Future plans
* Twitter integration
* Simple build-tools for making your own text based game, hopefully with publishing options
* Some sort of memory/saving feature
