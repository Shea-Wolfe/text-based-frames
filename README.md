## Getting started

* The key files in this repo are classes.py, text_parser.py, generation.py, and game_unpacker.py.
* Once you have the above files.  Run `python generation.py` and follow the commands to create your own game.
* At the end of generation you will be prompted to enter a name for your games.  This will write it as a pickled file in the current repo.
* To play a game you've created run `python game_unpacker.py 'your_gamename_here'` 
* Saving a game in progress works the same as creating a game, the name you provide will be written out as a pickled file.  
* To resume a saved game run `python game_unpacker.py 'your_savename_here'`

## Description

* This repo is dedicated to creating simple text based games using python. 

## Future plans
* Twitter integration
* Try to get it running in a browser rather than terminal
